            <h2>About</h2><br>
            <div class="col-md-10 col-md-push-1" id="col2">

                <p>I often solve challenging problems from my horse’s back or with my dog’s leash in hand. Nothing
                    excites (or scares) me more than a problem that I have no idea how to solve. I find joy in the
                    process of uncovering and refining a solution.</p>

                <p>The nature of the problems I tackle has changed over the years. During my undergraduate studies, I
                    analyzed the impact of different macroeconomic policies. At Plexuss, I used machine learning to
                    predict the college that a student would enroll in. Currently, I am interested in how to exploit
                    computer architecture to make programs run faster.</p>

                <p>I discovered my love for computer science at the end of my undergraduate career. While continuing to
                    learn on the job and through continuing education courses, I gradually transitioned into
                    development. But, there was so much more to learn! I started my MS program in CS at UC Davis in
                    2020. I came into my first quarter focused on pursuing AI and NLP, but after taking one computer
                    architecture course, that plan changed.</p>

                <p>Since then, I have completed advanced computer architecture and performance engineering
                    courses. I also gladly traded in my beloved Python for C (I never thought that day would come).
                    Other
                    languages and technologies I use include Linux, C++, PHP, Bash, PostgreSQL, gem5, and x86. I also
                    work with front-end languages (HTML, CSS, and JS) as a hobby, and recently had the opportunity to
                    teach a front-end design class at Davis. This was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
                </p>

                <p>When I'm not writing code, you can find me exploring a new trail with my dog or horse, practicing
                    yoga, playing FFXIV, or learning Japanese.</p>
